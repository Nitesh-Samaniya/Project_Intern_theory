Intern Theroy Team -

Challenges -
============

1\. Communication
=================

Distance always matters for group work. As we are from different parts of India, miscommunications were the common challenge for us. But, we make it happen with the help of *slack* and *Zoom*

2\. Collaboration
=================

As we are using Git collaboration, due to the inexperience in using the platform, initially we were facing some technical issues, but continuously co-ordinations, make things easier

*These two challenges improved our abilities to be good **Team Player.*

Conclusion -
============

I would like to thank, all of my team members, *Nitesh Samaniya, Aman Kumar, Arijit Bhatta, Surya Mohrana and Avinash Kumar* for their contribution. this wouldn't have been possible without the cooperative work of the whole team.
